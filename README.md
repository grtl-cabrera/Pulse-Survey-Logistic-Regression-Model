# Pulse-Survey-Logistic-Regression-Model
This repo host a script for a logistic regression model that predicts survey responses for the pulse survey at SF Marin Food Bank

The objective of this logistic regression model is to identify factors associated with participants' likelihood of responding to our monthly pulse survey. The dataset includes 3,282 observations, with approximately 10% of participants having responded. Key predictors examined in the model include race, primary language, gender, the name of the program in which the participant is enrolled and whether the participant responded to our annual survey.
